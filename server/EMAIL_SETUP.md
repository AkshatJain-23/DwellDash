# Email Setup Guide for DwellDash

This guide will help you configure email sending for password reset functionality.

## Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended for Development)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account settings â†’ Security
2. Click on "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
4. Enter "DwellDash" as the name
5. Copy the generated 16-character password

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=dwelldash3@gmail.com
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Other settings
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Option 2: Ethereal Email (Testing Only)

For testing purposes, the system will automatically use Ethereal Email if no Gmail configuration is provided. This creates temporary test email accounts and provides preview URLs.

No configuration needed - just run the app and check console for preview URLs.

## Option 3: Production Email Services

For production, consider using:

### SendGrid
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=dwelldash3@gmail.com
```

### Mailgun
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=mailgun
EMAIL_USER=your-mailgun-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-mailgun-password
EMAIL_FROM=dwelldash3@gmail.com
```

## Testing the Setup

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Go to login page and click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter an email address
4. Check console for:
   - Success message with email ID
   - Preview URL (for Ethereal Email)
   - Any error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail Issues
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Check app password is correct
- **"Less secure app access"**: Use App Password instead
- **"Username and Password not accepted"**: Enable 2FA and use App Password

### General Issues
- Check internet connection
- Verify email address format
- Check spam/junk folder
- Review server console logs

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly rotate API keys and passwords
- Monitor email sending quotas
